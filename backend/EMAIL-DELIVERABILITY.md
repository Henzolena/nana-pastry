# Email Deliverability Guide for Nana's Pastry

This guide provides best practices for ensuring high email deliverability rates for Nana's Pastry application emails.

## Current Configuration

Nana's Pastry is configured to use IONOS email service with the following settings:

```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.ionos.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_SECURE=true
EMAIL_USER=info@nanapastry.com
EMAIL_FROM="Nana's Pastry <info@nanapastry.com>"
EMAIL_REPLY_TO=info@nanapastry.com
```

## Monitoring Deliverability

### 1. Rate Limits

IONOS email service has the following sending limits:
- **Hourly Limit**: 500 emails per hour
- **Daily Limit**: 2,000 emails per day

To monitor and respect these limits:
- Implement a queue system for bulk email sending
- Add timestamp tracking for sent emails
- Consider adding a rate limiter in `email.service.ts`

### 2. Implement Delivery Tracking

For critical emails (order confirmations, account verification):
- Log email sending attempts and results
- Add read receipt tracking for important messages 
- Set up bounce notifications handling

### 3. Delivery Analytics

Consider adding:
- Simple email analytics dashboard
- Periodic delivery rate reports
- Failed email notification system

## Improving Email Templates

Current templates can be enhanced with:

1. **Better Branding**
   - Consistent color scheme matching website
   - Professional header/footer design
   - Mobile-responsive templates

2. **Localization Support**

3. **Content Best Practices**

## Technical Optimizations

### 1. DNS Configuration

For improved deliverability, implement:
- SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record

Example SPF record for IONOS:
```
v=spf1 include:ionos.com ~all
```

- Log all email sending activities for audit

### 3. Recipient Management
