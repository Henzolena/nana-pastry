# Roadmap for Frontend Checkout Implementation

## Phase 1: Shopping Cart Management

### 1.1. Cart State Management
- **Create CartContext & Provider**
  - Implement React Context API for global cart state
  - Define interfaces for cart items, cart state, and actions
  - Include functions for add/remove/update items
  - Calculate subtotals, taxes, delivery fees based on `serviceInfo` from `data.ts`

### 1.2. Cart UI Components
- **Cart Icon & Mini-Cart**
  - Floating icon showing item count
  - Dropdown preview with thumbnails and prices
- **Cart Page**
  - Full item listing with images, names, quantities, sizes
  - Ability to update quantities or remove items
  - Price breakdown with subtotal, tax estimates
  - "Proceed to Checkout" button

### 1.3. Persistent Cart Storage
- **LocalStorage Integration**
  - Save cart state to localStorage on change
  - Restore cart state on page reload
  - Create clear migration path for backend session storage later

## Phase 2: Checkout Flow - Standard Orders

### 2.1. Checkout Steps Setup
- **Multi-Step Form Architecture**
  - Create step navigation with progress indicator
  - Implement form state management across steps
  - Add validation for each step
  - Enable back/next navigation with state preservation

### 2.2. Customer Information Step
- **Personal Details Form**
  - Name, email, phone fields with validation
  - Save/load from localStorage for returning customers
  - Structure data for easy API integration later

### 2.3. Delivery/Pickup Options
- **Delivery Form**
  - Address fields with validation
  - Date/time selector with validation against `serviceInfo.orderLeadTime`
  - Dynamic delivery fee calculation using `serviceInfo.deliveryFees`
- **Pickup Form**
  - Store selection (if multiple locations)
  - Date/time picker with validation against business hours from `businessHours`

### 2.4. Order Review & Payment
- **Order Summary**
  - Comprehensive breakdown of all order details 
  - Final price calculation
- **Payment Method Selection**
  - Mock payment form (to be replaced with payment gateway)
  - Terms & conditions acceptance

### 2.5. Confirmation Screen
- **Success Page**
  - Order summary with confirmation number
  - Email notification template (frontend mock)
  - "Continue Shopping" option

## Phase 3: Custom Orders Flow

### 3.1. Custom Request Form
- **Detailed Form Implementation**
  - Based on `designProcess` steps from `data.ts`
  - Event details (type, date, time, servings)
  - Flavor preferences from aggregated `cake.flavors` in `data.ts`
  - Design description & references
  - Budget range
  - Special requirements and allergens

### 3.2. Consultation Booking
- **Scheduling Component**
  - Calendar integration for consultation booking
  - Time slot selection based on `businessHours`
  - Form for specific questions/requirements

### 3.3. Deposit Payment
- **Payment Interface**
  - Calculate deposit amount using `serviceInfo.depositAmount`
  - Mock deposit processing (frontend only)
  - Receipt generation

## Phase 4: Mock Backend Integration Points

### 4.1. API Service Layer
- **API Client Structure**
  - Create service modules that will later connect to real endpoints
  - Implement mock responses based on `data.ts`
  - Add loading states and error handling

### 4.2. Order Management
- **Order Creation**
  - Structure order objects consistent with future backend models
  - Generate mock order IDs and confirmations
  - Store completed orders in localStorage

### 4.3. Admin Interfaces (Optional)
- **Order Dashboard**
  - List of orders with status filtering
  - Order details view
  - Basic reporting for orders and products

## Phase 5: Frontend Refinement & Backend Preparation

### 5.1. State Management Refactoring
- **Transition Plan**
  - Replace local state with hooks designed for API integration
  - Implement loading/error states throughout UI
  - Add placeholder API response caching

### 5.2. Authentication Foundation
- **User Account Structure**
  - User registration/login UI (for order history)
  - Order history page linked to mock user accounts
  - Session management placeholders

### 5.3. Testing & Documentation
- **Test Coverage**
  - Unit tests for cart calculations 
  - Integration tests for checkout flow
  - Mock API tests
- **API Documentation**
  - Document expected endpoints, request/response formats
  - Create backend requirements document based on frontend needs

### 5.4. Performance Optimization
- **Load Time Improvements**
  - Image optimization for product previews
  - Code splitting for checkout flow
  - Lazy loading of non-critical components

## Implementation Notes

- **Component Reusability:** Build standalone, reusable components with clear props interfaces
- **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript interfaces matching `data.ts` structures throughout
- **Loading States:** Include skeleton loaders where API calls will eventually happen
- **Error Handling:** Design clear error states and recovery paths
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure checkout works well on mobile devices
- **Accessibility:** Maintain WCAG compliance for form elements
- **Backend Hooks:** Comment code with clear "TODO: Replace with API call" markers
